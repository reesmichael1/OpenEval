README

Welcome to OpenEval! OpenEval is an employee review system designed to make keeping track of employees. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

To use OpenEval, double click on the executable file (OpenEval.exe) in the same directory as this README. OpenEval will appear, but there will not be any employees or employers. In OpenEval, everything depends upon the employer, so you must create an employer before you can enter employees. To do so, click on the button that says "Create New Employer" in the bottom left-hand part of the window. A dialog box will appear with empty fields that you can fill about the employer.

You may add as many employers as you like. OpenEval will create a text file called EMPLOYERS.txt that contains all of the information about the employers. This file can be edited with any plaintext editor, but should not be edited while OpenEval is running.

This file can also be edited through OpenEval itself. To do so, click the "Edit Employer" button on the right hand side. A window will appear with the information contained in EMPLOYERS.txt, and the fields can be edited and submitted. Once the edits are submitted, they cannot be undone.

It is also possible to remove employers. To do so, click the "Remove Employer" button on the right hand side. A confirmation dialog will ask you to confirm your choice. Once an employer is removed, all employees assigned to the employer will also be removed, and the change cannot be undone.

Once an employer has been entered into OpenEval, it is possible to add employees. To do so, click on the button that says "Create New Employee" in the bottom left hand corner. A dialog box will appear with empty fields that you can fill about the employee.

You may add as many employees to each employee as you like.

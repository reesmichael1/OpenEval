README

Welcome to OpenEval! OpenEval is an employee review system designed to make keeping track of employees. It is written to be easy and lightweight to use.

To use OpenEval, double click on the executable file (OpenEval.exe) in the same directory as this README. OpenEval will appear, but there will not be any employees or employers. In OpenEval, everything depends upon the employer, so you must create an employer before you can enter employees. To do so, click on the button that says "Create New Employer" in the bottom left-hand part of the window. A dialog box will appear with empty fields that you can fill about the employer.
